Nom
===
##{Not in active Devlopment}
Although it was a fun project, it failed to reach the activation potential required to reach usage. The energy required to install a new app is too high.

Fast way to eat with others, use your existing social groups or let the app hook you up.
Inspired by /lasernite and the Yo app. Nom is designed with simplicity as a priority.

Backend currently running on a meteor server at nchinda2.mit.edu:666, but feel free to setup your own locally for testing.
Android files were designed using the ADTBundle version of Eclipse and can easily be imported. If you get Google Play
Services errors you most likely need to follow the instructions here: http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html#Install
to reference the libraries.
